# Student_Forms -dynamic-
This project demonstrates a intuitive web application that allows users to input their details through a form and view the saved data in a  table. It is used for managing and displaying dynamic user data on the client's side.

Features:

  -User Input Form:
  
  1) Collects user details such as Name, Age, Gender, Course, and E-mail.
  2) Provides a user-friendly interface with Bulma CSS for styling.
  
  -Data Display:
  
  1) Dynamically updates a table to display saved user data.
  2) Automatically clears the input form after saving the data.
  
  -Validation:
  
  1) Alerts the user if any required field is left empty, ensuring all inputs are filled before saving.
  
  -Interactive UI:
  
  1)Uses JavaScript to handle real-time data entry and display without the need for page reloads.


Technologies Used:
  
  -- Frontend: HTML, CSS (Bulma Framework), JavaScript.
  
  -- Libraries: Bulma CSS for responsive and modern styling.
  
  -- Backend: None (entirely client-side implementation).


How it Works:

  --  Users fill out the form fields (Name, Age, Gender, Course, Email).

  -- Clicking the "Save" button:
  
  1) Validates if all fields are filled.
  2) Updates the data table with the entered values.
  3) Clears the form inputs for the next entry.

  -- The data is displayed in a responsive, styled table beneath the form.

This project provides a foundation for more complex data-driven applications and is a practical demonstration of frontend web development with form handling and dynamic DOM manipulation.
